RemoteFunctionWithReplace
=========================

This plugin extends remote_function (and so link_to_remote) so that it supports
:replace (corresponding to Prototype's Element.replace) in addition to the normal
:update (which corresponds to Prototype's Element.update).

Particularly useful when you use render :collection with a partial that wraps
each object in the collection in its own DIV/TR/TD/whatever, as you often need to
replace the contents but would like to be able to reuse that same partial without
splitting it into wrapper & inner content partials.


Example
=======

<%= link_to_remote 'Refresh row', customer_path(customer), :replace => dom_id(customer) %>
<%= link_to_remote 'Refresh row', customer_path(customer), :replace => {:success => dom_id(customer), :failure => "errors"} %>
